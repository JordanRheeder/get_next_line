# get_next_line
My implementation of the get_next_line function for WeThinkCode_

This is a pre-requisite project for future projects! It allows for us to be able to read input from standard in or standard out using file descriptors.

A very essential project for Push_swap and lemin as we have to get inputs read from standard in.

Solved this project with the use of arrays, however I think using linked lists would have been more beneficial and more efficient.
